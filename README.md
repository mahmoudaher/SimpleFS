# Simple File System Simulator (SimpleFS)

# Project Description
This project simulates a simple file system over a virtual disk (`disk.sim`). 
It provides fundamental file operations using only low-level system calls** such as `open`, `read`, `write`, `lseek`, `close`, 
and othersâ€”without relying on any standard file I/O libraries.

The system mimics the structure of a basic file system with a **metadata section (first 4096 bytes)** followed by a **data storage region**. Each file has a name, size, starting address, and creation timestamp stored in the metadata.
